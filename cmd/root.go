that integrate with Python.

It provides commands to:
- Initialize Python environment for your Go project
- Build Go applications with Python environment properly configured
- Run Go applications with Python runtime support
- Install Go packages with Python dependencies
- Add or remove Python packages to/from your project

	// has an action associated with it:
	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) { },
}

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.

	// will be global for your application.

	// rootCmd.PersistentFlags().StringVar(&cfgFile, "config", "", "config file (default is $HOME/.go-python.yaml)")

	// Cobra also supports local flags, which will only run
	// when this action is called directly.
